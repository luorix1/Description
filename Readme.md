I am an undergrad at Seoul National University in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department.

While I am not an experienced developer, having mostly relied on open-source projects, I am always trying to learn and implement what I have learned.

I recently experienced what it is like to try something without any prior knowledge on the subject as an intern creating an RTMP streaming client for Windows.

I have always overcome problems by spending more time and effort on them and am a quick learner.

I am eager to do my best if given a chance.
